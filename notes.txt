we can render our html elements through jsx in react

we have a react-scripts in the package.json as a dependancy, this connects our html with js files in the program
we dont need to explicitly link js to html. When you make your project using vite it will not give node_modules and react-scripts
but it will explicitly link js to html using script tag

when we want to make a block of html code we wrap it inside div tags
in react we use <> </> and we call it a fragment this is jsx

react uses a bundler which converts our html syntax to jsx which is recognised by the react
it parses the html and creates a tree from which a DOM object is made which is rendered on the page 
if we have variables being rendered on the page, they are at the end of the tree

hooks in react are used to update the dynamic entities mainly the variables on the ui

props in reacts are used to make a resuable component, eg : you make a card from html, css and js we can put it inside an element and
reuse it anytime anywhere
